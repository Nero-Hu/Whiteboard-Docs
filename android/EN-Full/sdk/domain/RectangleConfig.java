 * Configurations for the view rectangle.

 *
 * The view rectangle defines a rectangular area that the view must cover.
 * After you set a view rectangle, the SDK automatically adjusts the view to fully contain the rectangular area, so as to ensure contents within the rectangle area are completely displayed.
 *
 * You can set a view rectangle according to the size of a PPT slide or image to be displayed, to ensure the same content is displayed completely on screens of different sizes.
