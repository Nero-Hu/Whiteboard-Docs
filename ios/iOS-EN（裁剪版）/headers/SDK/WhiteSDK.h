/**
 Declares the fonts that can be used in the local whiteboard.
 @since 2.11.3

 The fonts declared by this method can be used to render the characters in PPT and the characters entered by the text tool.

 Both this method and [loadFontFaces]([WhiteSDK loadFontFaces:completionHandler:]) can declare the fonts to be used in the local whiteboard.
 The difference is that `setupFontFaces` has no callback to report whether the font declaration is successful; loadFontFaces triggers callbacks to report the preload result of each type of font.

 **Note:**

 - This method works only for the local whiteboard and does not affect the font display of the remote whiteboard.
 - Fonts declared by this method will be downloaded only when they are used.
 - Font rendering may vary by device. For example, on some devices, the text will not be rendered until the font has finished loading, while on others, the text will be rendered first using the default font and then refreshed as a whole when the specified font has finished loading.
 - Each time this method is called, it overrides the original font declaration.
 - Do not call this method and the [loadFontFaces]([WhiteSDK loadFontFaces:completionHandler:]) method at the same time; otherwise, unexpected results may occur.
